# Rainbow experiment part 2 
Creating an aesthetically pleasing particle system that reacts to the user's mouse movements was the aim of this experiment. Particles with shifting shapes and colours produce a dynamic visual impact. The particles create an interactive feature that improves visual perception by being drawn to the mouse cursor. The plume effect produced by the transparent background heightens the impression of movement and contact.
