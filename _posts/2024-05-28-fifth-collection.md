# Red Moon experiment 

This experiment was designed to investigate several 3D lighting methods with the p5.js package. The experiment shows how various lighting sources alter the appearance of 3D objects by combining directing light, diffused light, and a spotlight. An interactive feature that lets customers observe how the lighting changes as they move the mouse is the backlight that follows the mouse cursor. The lighting effects can be seen more clearly when the scene is turned in small circles. I started with the fundamental WebGL configuration and changed it to add ambient, directional, and spot lighting. While the focused light on the left adds a sense of depth and volume, the diffused light produces a gentle, ethereal glow. A dynamic element is added to the scene by a point light that is controlled by the mouse location. The red circle spins to provide the impression of depth and movement. Using the push() and pop() functions, I was able to isolate the circle's transformation while maintaining its original position during the trials. Even though there were some issues with the spot lighting's intensity and range, I was able to fix them by experimenting with different settings. In general, this code showcases my proficiency in utilising novel methods and imaginatively adjusting lighting and transforms to produce a captivating three-dimensional scene.
