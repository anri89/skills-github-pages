# Red Moon experiment 

This experiment was designed to investigate several 3D lighting methods with the p5.js package. The experiment shows how various lighting sources alter the appearance of 3D objects by combining directing light, diffused light, and a spotlight. An interactive feature that lets customers observe how the lighting changes as they move the mouse is the backlight that follows the mouse cursor. The lighting effects can be seen more clearly when the scene is turned in small circles.
