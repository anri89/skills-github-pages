# Saturn 
This experiment was designed to mimic the orbital motion of many satellites around the planet. The project illustrated how to utilise object-oriented programming in p5.js to control and animate a number of interconnected objects, including my favourite planet, Saturn, and its moons. The distinct characteristics of every moon, like its size, colour, and rotational speed, enhance the simulation's realism and intricacy.
