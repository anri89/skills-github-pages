# Saturn experiment  
This experiment was designed to mimic the orbital motion of many satellites around the planet. The project illustrated how to utilise object-oriented programming in p5.js to control and animate a number of interconnected objects, including my favourite planet, Saturn, and its moons. The distinct characteristics of every moon, like its size, colour, and rotational speed, enhance the simulation's realism and intricacy. The starting point was a basic online guide to creating circles and rotating objects in p5.js which I then modified to create a more complex and dynamic visual representation of Saturn and its moons. I used a combination of object-oriented programming (OOP) and mathematical concepts to create the Planet and Satellite classes, which allowed me to define the properties and behavior of each object. The development process involved experimenting with various parameters such as orbit radius, diameter, and velocity to achieve the desired visual effect. I also had to fix problems with positioning and moving objects, which required careful study of mathematical formulas and programming logic. Overall, I am pleased with the result, which effectively reflects the feeling of motion and the orbital behavior of the Saturn system.
