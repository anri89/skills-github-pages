# Hearts experiment 
This experiment was designed to provide an eye-catching visual impact by randomly moving many hearts across the canvas. The animation is made more interesting by the distinct qualities of each heart, such as its size, position, and colour. The erratic movement of the hearts produces a vibrant and dynamic scene, showcasing how p5.js uses object-oriented programming to efficiently manage and animate many objects.
