# Hearts experiment 
This experiment was designed to provide an eye-catching visual impact by randomly moving many hearts across the canvas. The animation is made more interesting by the distinct qualities of each heart, such as its size, position, and colour. The erratic movement of the hearts produces a vibrant and dynamic scene, showcasing how p5.js uses object-oriented programming to efficiently manage and animate many object. The initiation was to develop a stand alone swarm of hearts that move and engage in certain motion patterns. I also tried different approaches of the class-object model to implement and control hearts during the process of application development. First, I built the Heart base class that held the x, y, size, speed, and color fields. The update position of each triangle was changed using the move method, on the other hand the display method used the draw shape method to draw the shape of each triangle as a heart. Subroutines which were challenging to write include the drawHeart because it demanded writing of the bezierVertex function in order to draw a heart like shape. In this case, through trial and demonstration, I have come up with the relevant illusion as intended.
