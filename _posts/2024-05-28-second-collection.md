# Physics 
This experiment aimed to combine two distinct physical behaviours into one interactive simulation. The pendulum swings and the square falls loose, bouncing. Users can click and drag both objects to change how they move with mouse interaction. This experiment shows how basic forces like gravity and damping can produce realistic motion, illustrating the fundamentals of physical modelling and user interaction.
