# Physics experiment 
This project was initiated on the topic of physical modeling and interactive attributes, which were developed as a javascript library implementing p5. js. This is because at a certain point I wanted to do something new and trigger a new action. The main goal was to simulate a pendulum and a square, the latter of which was under the influence of gravity and reacted to the movement of the mouse, that is, it was an attempt to create objects obeying a real physical law. At the beginning of the development process, a new class called Pendulum was created. An imitation of a pendulum that demonstrates the real physical phenomena of gravity, angular acceleration and damping, simulating the force of friction, which was not easy to create, since for me it is still a new programming system. Since the position of the pendulum is calculated using trigonometric functions, it is first released and oscillates back and forth. The two main tasks here were to achieve smooth and natural movement, which in this case was solved by using the correct gravity and damping settings. Then I added interactivity by giving users the ability to control the pendulum by clicking and dragging. This was done using several functions implemented in the code (handleClick, handleDrag and handleRelease), as well as using events to enable dragging and adjust the position of the pendulum according to the position of the mouse cursor. This made the simulation more fun and dynamic due to the interactive aspect that students had direct access to. At the same time, I prepared the lesson "Square" - modeling a falling figure acting under the influence of gravity. The position of the square varies depending on its speed, and constant acceleration, simulating gravity, implies how many frames it should be shifted. To prevent the ball from passing through the grid of levels and improve its appearance due to a realistic bounce, a collision detection function has been built into the lower part of the canvas. Although both objects, the "+" and "-" objects, have the same properties with which you can click, drag and release objects. From the above functions for the square, it can be seen that when implementing such functions, especially the on_mouse_click function, there are problems with accurately detecting mouse clicks inside the square, as well as problems with smooth movement. Of particular importance was the attempt to achieve a subtle damping of the spring and the rebound of the square in order to simulate a decrease in energy after impact. This small additional feature has significantly improved the appearance of the simulator. Thus, this particular project is an excellent example of an effective combination of physical modeling with interactivity; thus, the result is an exciting and informative game for those who play it. The main task was to make the program as realistic as possible and at the same time optimize its performance; it had to easily perform physical calculations of the required equations, as well as respond effectively to the user's wishes. If the work that Isaac created as part of the visual assignment were improved in the future, there might be more physical interactions, as well as more forms that would increase the educational value and make it more attractive. Overall, the project is generally familiar and good for creative programming and interactive design.
