# Earth and Moon 

This experiment was designed to replicate a satellite's orbit around a planet. The exercise showed how to utilise object-oriented programming in p5.js to control and animate a range of related objects by building an Earth-like planet with randomly placed points and a lunar one orbiting. The moon's orbital location can be determined using trigonometric functions, demonstrating how basic mathematical ideas may be used to produce lifelike animations.
